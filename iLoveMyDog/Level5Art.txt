IMPORTANT NOTE 

Dear Smeeg, 
Its Godfree, ruler of the Aliens. I am 
writing this to you because I need you
to return to our secret hideout asap.
Do not lose this note or show it to any
body. Our hideout is a very nice, fine
dining establishment on 169 Court Rd.
Don't forget to capture the human who 
has been eliminating our brothers and
bring him to our base. His dog has 
already been captured.

Sincerly,
Godfree, ruler of the Aliens.
