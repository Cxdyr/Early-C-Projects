reporter:
Hello all, Mike McOwsky here with the news
report for the day.
It seems there are clear skys and no traffic in
little town, but there is a... *under breath: alie-
an alien invasion?* that can't be right.
Well folks I guess theres an alien invasion, the government
has only said that they target dogs and use them as fuel for
their ships and whatnot. Whatever alien stuff they need to 
charge. This entire bit is getting boring... alright good luck.
