# ILoveMyDog-Game

This is a game I coded in my free time (1/2023) using a bunch of basic functions to simplify and make basically a replica of a
lot of game like functions. I use basic c++ to make a game with independent levels functionally and you can skip levels upon
registration, it has a bunch of art files, this will absolutely not run without the .txt files with the art. Do not change their names
either, I have a display art function that litterally takes a string of their names as input. I had a music file .wav but It cant be transfered so I suggest downloading it and then transfering it to .wav saving to this file then using, either that or commment it out
and dont listen to music.    // https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/29978/    <- song  

line 270 roughly, should be easy to find with my comments. 

Read the top of main comments if any other questions arise, ascii art is mostly from // https://www.asciiart.eu/space/aliens
refer to this video as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3k_dqzbZuk&t=1072s&ab_channel=CodyRabie

Thanks, enjoy if you play it or at least read the code.
