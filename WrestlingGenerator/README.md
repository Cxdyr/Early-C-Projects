This is a project I worked on in my second CS class (6/2022) that involves a linked list of wrestlers that belong to a team.
We pair wrestlers in each team up against each other based on weight classes, then the winners are determined by random skill
values and other factors. It is a good bit more complex than the coin tracker project I worked on before hand.
