This is a project I worked on shortly after learning about iterators in one of my CS classes (2/2023). It creates a castle that has access to a list of troops
who have health, hunger, damage, and ids. These troops have to be fed otherwise they die from hunger etc. The castle is randomly attacked and if the castle
defenses fall the troops have to fight the attackers. 

It is a pretty basic piece of code and is simple to understand, yet I think it is pretty cool. 
This video explains my code fairly well <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bve8s2kpZUs&t=1556s&ab_channel=CodyRabie>
