This is a peice of code I worked on for fun shortly after watching the movie interstellar (2/2023), it is a very basic peice of code that simply simulates an
asteroid game with some added features. It can be easily added on to / implemented differently but I made it in 1 hour for fun.

These two videos explain the creation of the code from start to finish
