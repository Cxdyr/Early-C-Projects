This is a basic piece of code that simulates an online casino, I coded this after completing CS150, my first CS class (1/2022). It has 2 games,
coin flip game and rock,paper,scissors. It keeps track of the wager amounts and outputs them to a file afterwards. It is very basic but a cool piece
of code considering I have almost no knowledge at the time.
